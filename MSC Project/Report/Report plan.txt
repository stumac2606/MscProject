Method
	participants (paragraph to describe who the participants were etc.)
	
	experimental setup 
	(hardware and software setup including desktop)

	experimental design 
	and procedure (your trial structures e.g. phases and how long 	each phase was and how long each trial was and what they did 	throughout the experiment, include a short description of a 	typical trial)can show this as a figure (phases)

	data analysis
	Here say what the data was you collected i.e. frame rate/ frame by 	frame at 100 Hz
	What did you do with the data i.e. your analysis script in python
	
Results
	Only descriptions of your data i.e. what you saw in each graph and 	how you got to those graphs, including what statistical tests you 	performed? 

	Do this in a logically hierarchical way:
	1st: you show a typical trial data i.e. over the 15 seconds 	trajectories 
	
	Then you averaged the performance of each user across each phase 	then show the bar graph

Discussions
	Summary of everything from the start 

	Interpret your data why you got those results you think, in context 	of the literature 

	Limitations of your setup/results etc. participants 

	Future, what could be done etc. 

	Nice and positive paragraph stating what you did and the 	contributions your study provided
